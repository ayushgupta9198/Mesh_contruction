# Mesh_contruction

This code is able to generate mesh from flat 2d images.

Here there two things which I have edited in the code when you run the final code cell.
If your requirement is to generate the mesh with/without its texture then you have to comment/uncomment certain code lines in the final code cell , it is already mention as comment in the code as line number 35.

Thanks
